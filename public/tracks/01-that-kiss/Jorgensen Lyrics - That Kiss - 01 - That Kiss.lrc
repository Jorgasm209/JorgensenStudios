[00:00.00]We were sitting side by side not a word to say.
[00:16.00]Her friend stepped out in the silent state.
[00:22.00]My chest got tied, my hands shook low.
[00:29.00]She smiled like she knew but let it go.
[00:35.00]I'm not the kind of freeze or stall.
[00:40.00]But her laugh faded and I felt it all.
[00:47.00]Her eyes found mine soft and wide.
[00:53.00]And I leaned in slow with nowhere to hide.
[00:58.00]That kiss hit hard like a wave on stone.
[01:04.00]Tore right through the herd I'd carried along.
[01:10.00]I was shaking like hell couldn't catch my breath but she leaned in calm.
[01:14.00]Like she had none left it was more than touch.
[01:18.00]More than lips it was truth in the quiet.
[01:21.00]Yeah I'll never forget that kiss.
[01:28.00]She didn't flinch, didn't tease just smile low.
[01:34.00]Like she planned it out and now I've known.
[01:40.00]I pulled back stone trying to find my pride.
[01:45.00]But her laugh faded and I felt it all.
[01:51.00]Her laugh faded and I felt it all.
[01:57.00]Her eyes found mine soft and wide.
[02:02.00]She smiled like she knew but let it go.
[02:07.00]I'm not the kind of freeze or stall.
[02:11.00]Tore right through the herd I'd carried along.
[02:17.00]I was shaking like hell couldn't catch my breath.
[02:22.00]That kiss hit hard like a wave on stone.
[02:28.00]Tore right through the herd I'd carried along.
[02:32.00]I was shaking like hell couldn't catch my breath.
[02:38.00]And I think sometimes how it all began.
[02:43.00]With a trembling boy in her steady hand.
[02:49.00]No battles, no words just a moment like this.
[02:55.00]Everything we are started with that kiss.
[03:07.00]And I think I'm the kind of freeze or stall.
[03:14.00]And I think sometimes how it all began.
[03:20.00]I think sometimes how it all began.
[03:25.00]I think sometimes how it all began.
