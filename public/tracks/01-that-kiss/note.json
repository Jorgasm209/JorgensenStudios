  "note": "That Kiss isn\u2019t just the first track. It\u2019s the reason this album exists.\n\nIt was the moment everything changed. No words, no preparation... just a kiss that shook me to my core.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t soft or sweet. It was raw, real, and terrifying. It was the first time I knew, without a doubt, that everything I thought I knew about love was about to be rewritten.\n\nThis song is my way of going back to that moment. Because without it, none of this... not the album, not the life we\u2019ve built... would have ever happened."
