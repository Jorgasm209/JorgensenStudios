  "note": "This song is about more than our wedding. It\u2019s about everything that came before it.\n\nIt\u2019s about a love that found me unexpectedly... and stood strong when I couldn\u2019t. A love that saw me clearly, even on the days I barely recognized myself.\n\nMore Than Just October is my way of honoring the road we walked to get here... the struggles, the healing, the laughter, and all the good days that made the hard ones worth it.\n\nWhat happens on our wedding day will be beautiful. But the real story is everything that led us there."
