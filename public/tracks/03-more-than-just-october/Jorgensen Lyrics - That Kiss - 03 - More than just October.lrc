[00:00.00]He wore flannel like a gun, boots worn thin, quiet as dust with a storm deep within.
[00:16.82]She came in loud like a Saturday crowd, laughing so loud he forgot about doubt.
[00:24.78]She was mounting calm, she was wildfire grace, built something steady in a fast burning place.
[00:33.10]From California nights to the Wyoming pines, they held on through heartbreak through space and time.
[00:42.29]They're more than just October, more than vows in autumn there.
[00:51.17]More than rings and wedding roses, they're the fight, the faith, the prayer.
[00:59.50]Through every damn hard season, they stayed and did and run, brine and Nancy.
[01:09.90]That's the love that don't come undone.
[01:15.34]She lights up the room without saying a word, a laugh like a song that's always been heard.
[01:23.82]He keeps things grounded, she makes life spin, and every good story starts right there with them.
[01:32.54]They made a home race to boy and a girl built joy in the mess of a spinning world.
[01:40.85]She's got fire, he's got steam, they've got scars and that's how real love is.
[01:50.37]They're more than just October, more than photo or a kiss.
[01:58.53]Lift 3 a.m. forgiveness and holding hands through all of this.
[02:06.69]Through hard times and late night laughter, they chose each other still,
[02:14.62]brining and Nancy, a love you rock songs about until.
[02:30.85]This ain't fairy tale, it's grid and grace, laughing the dark,
[02:37.50]a hand on your face, a whisper of stain when it's hard to be strong,
[02:43.81]a fire that's steady and burns all life long.
[02:49.34]They're more than just October, they're every mile every test.
[02:57.18]Their Sunday morning's roadside prayers and promises kept in unrest.
[03:05.65]Through all this been and all that will be,
[03:09.81]they're the roots of their own old tree,
[03:13.50]brining and Nancy, that's the kind of love that sets you free.
