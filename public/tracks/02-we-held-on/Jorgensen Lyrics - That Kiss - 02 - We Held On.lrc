[00:00.00]We don't yell or slam the doors, but silence cuts us to the core.
[00:20.55]You turn away, not overthink, two souls too tired to even blink.
[00:27.32]Most of the way I put it there to stubborn to bend, to proud to care.
[00:34.28]You gave me time, I gave you space, but I was so lost in that quiet place.
[00:41.20]Still we held on when the night got along, when the felt distant but never gone.
[00:48.40]It wasn't lies or money, oh, just the way we see the world unfold.
[00:55.32]We felt the cracks but never broke, swallowed fire and breathed and smoked.
[01:01.71]It hurt like hell to come the dawn we held on.
[01:08.51]You're wild and loud, I'm slow and still, you lead with heart, I lead with will.
[01:15.40]But where you burn, I build the ground, and somehow that keeps love around.
[01:22.28]We didn't fall, we learned to fight, we'll open hands and stay despite.
[01:29.07]The tears we cried just cleared the way for something deeper every day.
[01:35.87]Yeah, we held on when the wind blew rough, when being different fell too tough.
[01:42.52]But we never let that distance win, we circled back and let it love in.
[01:49.87]It ain't perfect, but it's strong.
[01:56.51]And we held on.
[02:10.35]Call it fate or grace or just plain grit, but every time we almost quit, we found a thread.
[02:18.75]We tied it tight and made it through another night.
[02:23.87]Yeah, we held on when the road got thin, when silence roared beneath our skin.
[02:30.75]Now look at us, still going strong, proof that love can ride the wrong.
[02:37.63]It wasn't love, it was choice all along.
[02:44.59]We held on.
[02:50.91]Yeah, we held on.
