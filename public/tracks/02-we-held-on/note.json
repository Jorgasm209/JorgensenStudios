  "note": "This song is about the moments I almost lost her... and the reasons I didn\u2019t.\n\nWe\u2019re both stubborn. We\u2019ve had our share of hard nights and heavy silence. There were times I didn\u2019t know how to fix it... only that I didn\u2019t want to lose her.\n\nWe Held On is my reflection on those fights... not the loud kind, but the ones where love is tested in quiet, painful ways.\n\nAnd still... we stayed. We grew. We chose each other again and again.\n\nThat\u2019s what this song is really about. Not just holding on... but holding on when it mattered most."
